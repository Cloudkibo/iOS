## Adding a friend##

Your friend's phone number must be in your phone's address book in order for you to start a chat with them in KiboApp.

If you cannot see your friend in WhatsApp, please follow these steps:

1- Ensure that your friend has KiboApp installed on their phone.
	
2- Double check that your friend's phone number is  entered correctly in your phone's address book.
	
	

 - Enter the number same as you would if you were to make a phone call to that person.
	
	
 - If this is an international phone number, do not use any exit codes or leading 0s. Start all international phone numbers with a + sign, followed by the country code. For specific examples and instructions, see this article.
	
3- Open KiboApp and open the Favorites list. It will show Contacts which are on KiboApp

Contacts in your phone's address book that have KiboApp will be displayed in the Favorites list (Contacts tab on Android). In KiboApp, you can only start a chat with these contacts.

If you still do not see your friend in your KiboApp list, it is possible that your friend does not have KiboApp.
